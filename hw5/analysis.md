1. What is the time-complexity of heapMerge(..) assuming the size of each heap is O(n).

- 2n (log 2n) ... remove coefficients
- O(n log(n))

2. What is the time-complexities of buildHeap(), addHeap(), and removeHeap()

- buildHeap()
    O(n log(n))
- addHeap()
    O(log(n))
- removeHeap()
    O(log(n))
