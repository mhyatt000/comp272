The BinarySearchTree (aka BST) only works on types (E) which are comparable, example, Integer, String, etc.  We will go over the insert() method and contains() method in class on Tuesday.  I have also provided a BinarySearchTree.java file with methods you need to implement.  Submit three java files to Sakai and on GitHub public folder with a link

## Implemented Methods:

public BinarySearchTree() {}

public BinarySearchTree(E val) {}

public boolean contains (E val) {}

public void insert(E val) {}

public E findMin() {}
    
public E findMax() {}
